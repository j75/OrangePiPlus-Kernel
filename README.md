# OrangePi+ Kernel

This repository enables building a 3.4.39 kernel for a [OrangePiPlus](http://linux-sunxi.org/Xunlong_Orange_Pi_Plus) board.

It is based on [Loboris](https://github.com/loboris/OrangePI-Kernel/) kernel, however
  * it produces a smaller kernel (800 k instead of 1M)
  * more drivers are included in

## Issues
  * use a 4.x kernel
